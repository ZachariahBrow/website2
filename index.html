   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p>Hello there. My name is Zachariah Brown, and I am a senior at Fern Creek High School. Being a senior, this is my 4th year in the computer science program, and my second year doing stuff related to project based programming (the other two was the intro to computer principles and then ap computer science principles). I decided to join the program because I was just figuring out that I wanted to involve technology (specifically computers) to be in my life a lot, as it is something I love and enjoy. I know how to build a desktop computer, well mostly, so I decided to learn all of the programs and programming behind it. It gets difficult at times, frustrating as well. Sometimes you'll want to give up and delete it. But you don't get this far by giving up, you make it this far by taking a breather, asking for help and giving it your all. That is why I'm still doing this, learning how to code and understand programming languages, because it is something that I want to do when I am older, so I have to give it my all. </p>

   <p>I didn't always want to do computers. The switch to technology was recent, because when I was a small child, I was all over the place. I wanted to be a doctor, then an author, then a basketball player and a doctor all over again. I didn't grow up with the technology needed to learn how to do the things I do now. Yes, we had a simple laptop, but growing up with destructive siblings, it sort of got destroyed when they had to get off of it. So I never really have time to learn how to code. It wasn't until I could understand what was being talked about in a Youtube video that I had begun my way into the computer science world. Although, a little detour was taken when I began middle school, because I had joined the robotics program. I stayed in that in all of highschool, and the team I was with made me the designated programmer, so that is where it started officially. I loved it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in it. Yes, it is very different from computer programming and software, but hey, it's a start.</p>

   <p>Now, I may not have the same amount of experience as my classmates currently, but that is what school and that class is for, to learn something that you don't know. I look over the code shown, learn how it works, rewrite it a few times and then I begin to understand what specific parts of the code is doing. I can code Python, as that is what we are taught in school, HTML, and we are learning about all sorts of other programming languages that would help us in the computer software world. It gets intimidating and makes me feel bad about myself knowing that they currently know more than ke, but I try not to let it get to me as there are many things that I can do that they can't, because I keep learning more and more each day.  </p>

   <h2>My Work</h2>

   <p>As mentioned before, my skills aren't that great, and most of my coding that I have done I had received help from my peers and teachers, so I incorporated some of their work into mone, because it helped me finish mine. A big majority of my programming have been on Replit.com. Down below, you can see a snippet of one of the things we did at the beginning of my senior year, a project called Using an API and JSON. It was an interesting project in my opinion, something that was fun to learn and get to know how to do, because I feel like it would help me out at some point in my future career as a software developer.</p>
   
   <p>This piece of code is a project that we had to sort of come up with on our own (some was given by the teacher). we had to make a program that generates a mini trivia quiz, 10 questions, about a subject of choosing. We were learning JSON while doing this, as it became very helpful to know for this project. At first, I had struggled with it because I honestly knew nothing about it. It was all new to me, and I thought that I wasn't gonna be able to complete it, that I wouldn't be able to answer a question correctly if called on. But, I didn't give up. I paid attention, listened to the teacher and looked at the sample code given, while looking at different websites to help me learn as well. We have also done a project where we made an "about me" program, in which when ran, it tells you about the user (aka me). There is a file that has all of the questions, one that has all of the responses and one where the actual code is, and you can see that below.</p>

   


   <p>If I remember it correctly, this was our very first "project of the year", as it was a refresher on what we knew. And me not knowing a lot about it, I definitely needed the refresher. Both projects are programmed in Python, as mentioned before, because that is what we were learing at the beginning of the year. We had to make a list including our name, our age and our hobbies. It was a very good refresher, as it helped me remember all of what I needed to in order to get the work done.</p>
